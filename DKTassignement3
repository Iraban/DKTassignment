Services

Q: You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. 
You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. 
But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. 
Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue.

Ans:
Check the port type:

Application will be reachable if the port is given as NodePort, and the <IPAddress:PortNum> set is correct.

1st check the port.
[root@ip-172-31-41-124 05-services]# kubectl get svc
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes       ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        26m
kubia-nodeport   NodePort    10.96.240.28   <none>        80:30123/TCP   24s
[root@ip-172-31-41-124 05-services]# kubectl get ep
NAME             ENDPOINTS                                                     AGE
kubernetes       172.31.41.124:6443                                            26m
kubia-nodeport   192.168.49.158:8080,192.168.49.159:8080,192.168.49.160:8080   47s

If it is NodePort is correct, take the corresponding port number 

In above it is 30123.

Ensure the IPAddress:PortAddress is correct.
