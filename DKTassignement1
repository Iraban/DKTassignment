Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.
Ans:
Replica Set is good for transactions, where if one pods gets deleted, it is automaically created. 
Daemon Set is good for background activities like monitoring or logs collection, which needs to be continuously running without any intervention.
Hence for all background activities, better to open daemon set.
